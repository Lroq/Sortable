# SORTABLE

`SORTABLE` is a sorting library designed to provide various sorting algorithms in a simple and efficient manner. This library allows users to sort arrays of integers, strings, or custom data types with different sorting methods.

## Features

- Implementation of multiple sorting algorithms, including:
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
- Support for sorting arrays of integers and strings
- Easy-to-use API
- Performance benchmarks for each sorting algorithm

## Algorithms

The following sorting algorithms are implemented:

1. **Quick Sort**  
   An efficient, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm with average time complexity of O(n log n).

2. **Merge Sort**  
   A stable sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer approach, with a time complexity of O(n log n).

3. **Bubble Sort**  
   A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm with a worst-case time complexity of O(n²), primarily used for educational purposes.

4. **Insertion Sort**  
   An efficient algorithm for small datasets with a time complexity of O(n²) in the worst case, but O(n) in the best case.
